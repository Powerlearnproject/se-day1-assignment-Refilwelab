#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering systemtically applies engineering principles methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems it involves software product design development testing ,deployment and maintenancs.
the importance of software engineering is that it plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects modern life including communication ,commerce,entertainment and healthcare
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.software crises-characterised by escalating software defects ,project delays and cost overruns 
-led to a realization that traditional approaches to software development were inadequate
-sparked the search for new methodologies and tools to improve software quality and productivity
2.structured programming-introduced concepts modularized ,control flow structure and data abstraction 
-facilitated code comprehension and maintanance
-laid the foundation for modern ,software engineering principles such as separation of concerns 
3.angile software development -emphasizes iterative and incremental development ,customer collaboration and continuos improvement
-focuses on delivering working software frequently ,rather than waiting for a complete product 
-based on principles such as test driven development,continuos integrationand pair programming 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.planning -define the project plan and schedule
           -create a project plan and schedule
           -create a software requirements specification 
2.analysis-gather and analyze user requirements 
           -identify system constraints and dependencies 
           -create a detailed design documents 
3.implementatin -code the software according to the design 
                -create unit tests to verify functionality 
                -intergrate the code into the system
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology
1.linear approach:task are completea sequentially,with each phase dependent on the previous one 



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.roles-design ,develop,and implement software solutions 
       -write and maintain code according to project specificstions
       -collaborate with other developers and engineers to create a cohesive software product  
2.responsibilities-break down user requirements into technical specifications 
                  -choose appropriate programming languages and technologies 
                  -write debug and test code 
                  -conduct code reviews to ensure quality and efficiency
                  -contribute to documantation and technical manuals 
3.quality assurance engineer roles
  -test software for defects and bugs 
  -plan and execute test scenarios 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
